# PromSec: Prompt Optimization for Secure Generation of Functional Source Code with Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview

This repository contains a demo implementation code for the paper:

*M. Nazzal, I. Khalil, A. Khreishah, and N.H. Phan, "PromSec: Prompt Optimization for Secure Generation of Functional Source Code with Large Language Models (LLMs)," Accepted for presentation at the 31st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2024), Salt Lake City, UT, USA, Oct. 2024.*

PromSec is a novel approach that ustilizes graph-based Generative Adversarial Networks (gGANs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate secure and functional source code.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a graph-based Generative Adversarial Network (gGAN)
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT model for code generation
- Control Flow Graph (CFG) generation and analysis
- Vulnerability assessment using Bandit
- Iterative code improvement process

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- OpenAI API
- Bandit

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages

## Key Components

- `Generator` and `Discriminator` classes for the gGAN
- CFG generation functions
- Code vulnerability scanning using Bandit
- Iterative code improvement process
- Visualization of results

## Results

The code generates various plots and statistics, including:
- CWE counts per code base
- CWE ID histograms
- Iteration count for code cleansing
- Remaining CWEs after iterations

Results are saved in a designated folder with timestamp.
